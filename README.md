We know how many of you used reset's APIs to make stuffs in your bot, and we understand the frustration which we all went through since the API started getting down more often than usual. So krish decided to release the entire API to the public. All the endpoints work except few which required private API keys.
The API is open-sourced and therefore free for everyone, krish will be adding more endpoints with time (you will have to fork the new ones with every updates) which you can get notified of from his support discord server.

# Hosting API

1. Create an account in <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> and <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/">Uptimerobot</a> if you havent already.
2. Open this <a href="https://replit.com/@resetxd/lazy-ppl-made-me-do-this?v=1">link</a> and Click the **[Fork Repl]** button.
3. Wait for some time, the Repl will load up in your own replit.
4. Click the **[Run Button]** and you will get a URL on the top (if phone), top right (if PC) which would look like **"https://repl_name.your_username.repl.co/"** after some time. This is your Base URL. And your API is deployed. You can use for example emojify endpoint as **"https://repl_name.username.repl.co/emojify?text=omg"**

PS : in `app.py` there is a line with a token variable where you can give your discord bot token to use the `/users` endpoint.

# Making the API 24/7

1. To make the API 24/7, go to the <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/">Uptimerobot</a> and create new monitor, and setup the stuffs as shown in this image

3. Your API is now deployed and will work 24/7 (almost, if replit is doesnt get crazy as it always does). If the API somehow dies, you can open up the Replit and run it again.

These steps are not requires if you have a hacker Plan in replit.
